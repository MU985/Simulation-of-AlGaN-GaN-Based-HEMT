# Simulation of AlGaN/GaN Based HEMT

Simulation of an **AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT)** for hydrogen (H₂) gas sensing applications.  
This project models how hydrogen adsorption affects device electrical characteristics and evaluates the sensitivity of GaN-based sensors.

##  Project Overview
This project simulates an AlGaN/GaN HEMT structure using TCAD to study hydrogen gas detection.  
When hydrogen interacts with the Pd gate, it modifies the work function and 2DEG density, causing measurable changes in drain current.
